# The Worldwide Trade Impact of COVID-19

In our project, we analyze and reveal some important facts about the trade 
sector during pandemic by using dashboards and a report. We collected export 
data from international organizationsâ€™ databases (e.g.WTO Database, UN comtrade 
and IMF trade flows), COVID-19 and economic indicators data (e.g. Our World in 
Data & World Bank). Then, we leveraged them by creating an interactive dashboard 
and providing an analysis report.
