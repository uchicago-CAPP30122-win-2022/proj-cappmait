# What is this

In our project, we analyze and reveal some important facts about the trade 
sector during pandemic by using dashboards and a report. We collected export 
data from international organizationsâ€™ databases (e.g. WB WITS API, 
WTO Database, UN comtrade and IMF trade flows), COVID-19 and economic 
indicators data (e.g. Our World in Data & World Bank). Then, we leveraged them 
by creating interactive dashboards and providing an analysis report. 
Both products use dash and plotly as the core packages.
